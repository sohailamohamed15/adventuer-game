<p>Brown bears can be recognized by their most distinctive feature, their shoulder hump.  Super strong shoulder muscles help this bear to dig up roots and tear apart logs to find food.  These muscles are located in the ‘hump’ of the brown bear.  Brown bears can move rocks and logs and dig through hard soil and rocky ground using their long sharp claws when making their dens.</p>
